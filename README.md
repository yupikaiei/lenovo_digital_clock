# Flutter Clock

This is my Flutter Clock Face UI for the [Flutter Clock Challenge](https://flutter.dev/clock).

The clock has a Futuristic look and feel that not only tells the time but shows how much time of your day has passed and how much remains creating this way a sense of urgency in making the most out of your day.

You can check the source code [here](my_digital_clock)
